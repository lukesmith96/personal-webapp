                Joining AWS Security out of college was a dream come true. After spending my college career focusing on cloud computing, participating in the white hat security club, attending Linux club event, and studying in computer networking.
                \n
                The team I have been able to help lead focuses on endpoint security and network visibility. We develop the tools that secure and validate the security of Amazon's vast network. This security directly correlates to trust by customers and employees. I lead the development of a geographically distributed network canary, generating custom queries to test services across Amazonâ€™s global network. As well as being a part of the design and development of multiple different security services such as a local dns sinkhole now deployed over 500 thousand hosts, and other services to maintain Amazon's data security.
                \n
                I have been able to ship products that have been on the cutting edge of security in cloud computing, and drive the concept of uncompromising visibility in a zero trust network.

                I interned at Workday twice over two summers during my Sophomore and Juniors years of college. As part of the business intelligence team, I was able to build on my skills as a developer and as a leader. I had the privilege to work on the initial development phase of a new feature for Workday's customers.
                \n
                The feature was to expose a REST-based web endpoints for allowing 3rd party systems to request data dynamically. I built the first concept for a query language custom to Workday's parameters and then tied it in into their existing API framework. Since the project was just starting and the team didn't have any experience in building a query language and public facing APIs, the design and development was largely up to me.  I am proud of the impact that I had and strengthened my ability to problem solve without any guard rails, and consider how future development would be impacted by design decisions.

                At 17 and a junior in high school I joined Microsoft on the Azure Active Directory team. I was one of twenty local high school students accepted into the internship program out of over a thousand applicants.
                \n
                Microsoft was my first foray into professional development and one of the best experiences any high school student interested in tech and software could have.
                \n
                While there my task was to complete an end to end application that would validate the capabilities of Windows Azure Active Directory. This served as a platform to learn about about the professional systems that are required to develop. From planning, to writing specifications, and being able to communicate with a team about technical details. My team trusted me to deal with unknowns in the project and seek help when needed. Additionally, from a technical perspective I was required to utilize developer tools like, the command line, version control systems, and virtual machines.  While none of this is impressive now, looking back at the success here I still feel ahead of the game in experience in the work place and was able to solidify my thoughts on perusing a degree in computer science and passion in cloud computing.

                My membership with Tau Kappa Epsilon established my leadership abilities, highlighting leading by example and compromise.  My junior semester abroad at London's Metropolitan University gave me a home base to explore different cultures, perspectives, and technical practices. Working for InspiredFlight, a local startup, for my senior project strengthened my ability to deliver under a lot of ambiguity.
